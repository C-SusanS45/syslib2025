# PHP

PHP is a server-side programming language and must be installed and cofigured to work with webserver software (Apache).

Install PHP and libapache2-mod-php

```
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php
```

Check PHP version

```
php -v
```

Restart apache2

```
Sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Make sure Apache is active and running

```
Systemctl status apache2
```

If an Apache config file is changed run the config test to ensure the syntax is correct by doing the following

```
apachectl configtest
```

reload and restart Apache by doing the following:

```
sudo systemctl reload apache2
sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo systemctl status apache2 (make sure Apache is  running)
```
