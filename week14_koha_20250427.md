# Week 14: Install Koha Assignment

## Create a new VM Instance

Log into the Google Cloud console and create a new VM instance by doing the following:
1. Select the hamburger icon in the left corner and select computer engines - VM Instances.
2. Select Create instance
3. Set the following values:
    - Name = koha
    - Machine type = E2-medium(2 vCPUs, 4 GB Memory)
    - Allow HTTP traffic (in Networking)
    - In networking, add `koha-8080` to network tags
    - OS = Ubutu-20.04 LTS x86/64
    - Disk size = 20GB
4. Select Create

> [!CAUTION]
> Watch the dollar amount when creating the VM instance.  I accidently clicked on the wrong item and my VM price went from $25 a month to $3,500 a month!

Create a firewall rule by doing the following:
1. Select the hamburger icon in the left corner and select VPN Network -> Firewall
2. Select Create firewall rule
3. Name it `koha-opac`
4. Enter "Open port 8080 for the OPAC" in description
5. Click "Specific target tags"
6. Add `koha-8080` to target tags
7. Add "0.0.0.0/0" to "Source IPv4 ranges".
8. Check TCP and add "8080" in "Ports"
9. Select create.

## Prepare for Install

Update the VM using the following commands:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt -y autoremove
sudo apt clean
```

Install `gnupg2` and `apt-transport-https` with the following command:

```
sudo apt install gnupg2 apt-transport-https
```

Reboot using `sudo reboot now`.

## Add Koha Repository

Add the Koha repository by doing the following:

```
sudo echo 'deb http://debian.koha-community.org/koha stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/koha.list

sudo wget -qO- https://debian.koha-community.org/koha/gpg.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/koha.gpg > /dev/null

sudo gpg --show-keys /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/koha.gpg
```
With the last command, make sure the key is signed by the relevant people.  See below:

```
Koha Debian Package Signing Key (2015) <koha-devel@lists.koha-community.org>
```

## Install and Configure Koha

Update the repository using `sudo apt update`.

View the package information using `apt show koha-common`.  

Install koha-common using `sudo apt install koha-common` and select `y` to continue.  

> [!TIP]
> Command `apt search koha` will show `koha-common` and `koha-110n` as installed after installation is complete.

Navigate to directory `/etc/koha/` using command `cd /etc/koha/`.

create a backup of the `kohakoha-sites.conf` using  command `cp koha-sites.conf koha-sites.conf.backup`.

Open the file using Nano `sudo nano /etc/koha/koha-sites.conf` and change INTRAPORT to `8080`.  Save and Exit.

Install mysql using the following command `sudo apt install mysql-server`

Set the root MySql password, where XXXXXXXX is a strong passwrod, using the following commands:
```
sudo su
mysqladmin -u root password XXXXXXXX
exit
```

I got the following warning:

``
mysqladmin: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
``

Enable URL rewriting and CGI functionality using the following commands:

```
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2enmod cgi 
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Check the apache2 status to ensure it's running using `sudo systemctl status apache2`.

Create the database for Koha using command:

```
sudo koha-create --create-db bibliolib
```

Tell Apache to listen on port 8080 using by editing the ports.conf file.  First navigate to directory and make a backup of the ports.conf file using these commands:
```
cd /etc/apache2/
sudo cp ports.conf ports.conf.backup
```

Use `sudo nano /etc/apache2/ports.conf` to edit the file and add the following line under `Listen 80`:

```
Listen 8080
```

Use command `sudo apachectl configtest` to ensure the Apache changes are valid.  If they are valid, you should get `Syntax OK`.

Issue the following commands:

```
sudo a2dissite 000-default
sudo a2enmod deflate
sudo a2ensite bibliolib
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

Restart Apache using `sudo systemctl restart apache2`, and verify Apache is running using `sudo systemctl status apache2`.

Get the user name and password from the `/etc/koha/sites/bibliolib/koha-conf.xml`.  The information will be on under `<user>` and `<pass>` on line 257 - 258.

## Koha Web Installer and Configuration

From a web browser, navigate to the web installer using `http://IP-ADDRESS:8080` and log in using the credentials in the `koha-conf.xml` file. 

Using the [Introduction to the Koha installation process](https://koha-community.org/manual//22.11/en/html/installation.html) as a guide step through the installation steps.  Be sure to check all sample data check boxes and allow access to servers like the Library of Congress, to easily download sample items.  Select Import to install the default and selected data values.  

Continue through the installation process and create a staff login and password.  

Once logged into Koha set the OPACBaseURL to `http://IP-ADDRESS`, so you can view the public facing OPAC.

## Challenges

* Setting up the VM took a little time.  I had to review my notes, and the lecture notes before starting.
* Even though I imported all sample data I did not have any sample items.  I did have sample libraries and patrons.  
* When I tried to add items from the Library of Congress, I kept getting an error message that no items were found or it timed out.  I tried again the next day and it worked as expected.
